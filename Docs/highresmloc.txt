Instructions for downloading high-resolution topography dataset:
1) SRTM topography (at 90 m resolution) and ASTER G-DEM topography (at 30 m) in GMT format can be downloaded from: 
http://topex.ucsd.edu/gmtsar/demgen/

2) In order to make a custom cpt file for each new GMT topography plot, use makecpt as following:

This  example creates a new colour palette called output.cpt, with colours from an input cpt file stretched across the 
range 0 - 2000 m.

You can use a custom cpt file if you have one already by typing: 
makecpt -Ccustom.cpt -D -T0/2000 -Z > output.cpt

Or, you can use any of GMT's standard colour palettes (http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/it/howto/GMT/CPT/palettes.html), 
e.g. polar (type makecpt or man makecpt to see the list), then type:
makecpt -Cpolar -D -T0/2000 -Z > output.cpt

Note that you don't need the .cpt suffix if you use a built-in colour table.
 
-T gives you the top and bottom values for the new colour palette file "output.cpt" which is define don the basis of the 
lower and upper limits of elevations found within the map bounds found by using grdcut and grdinfo

 >>>To do this, use grdcut to trim the DEM to the bounds of the figure, and then grdinfo to find out the maximum and minimum
elevation values contained within the scene <<<

-D means that background and foreground colours are set to match the top and bottom limits of the new colour palette. 
(e.g. if your scene contains some elevations above 2000 m, then they will be assigned the colour for 2000 m).

-Z means make a continuous, rather than contoured, colour palette
