## Introduction

MLOC is a multiple-events relocation program developed and maintained by [Eric Bergman](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Bergman2) since 1990. This tutorial is a skeleton iteration based on the MLOC Training Workshop held by Eric and [Ezgi](https://inside.mines.edu/~ekarasoz/) that I am honored to participate in Albuquerque, NM from 10/15/18 to 10/19/18.
